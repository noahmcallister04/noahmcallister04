[comment]: <> ## 🏆 Projects
### [Lone Wolf Watering Hole - Web Design](lonewolfwateringhole.com)
[I created the website for Lone Wolf Watering Hole. All images were provided to me. I utilized Tapped API to integrate the drink menu for the site. Although I didn't do much coding in this project, I feel like it was great experience on building a product for a customer and organizing the site enough that the owner could manage it himself.] - Built with [Wix]
