🏆 Current Projects
### [Lone Wolf Watering Hole - Web Design](lonewolfwateringhole.com) [STATUS: COMPLETE]
[I created the website for Lone Wolf Watering Hole. All images were provided to me. I utilized Tapped API to integrate the drink menu for the site. Although I didn't do much coding in this project, I feel like it was great experience on building a product for a customer and organizing the site enough that the owner could manage it himself.] - Built with [Wix]

### [Python Data Scraper] [STATUS: CURRENTLY WORKING]
[I am currently working on a simple data scraper that uses BeutifulSoup to pull data using a URL. The data will be saved onto a CSV File and I will create a seperate program to manage the data with simple CRUD Operations.] - Using [Python], [BeautifulSoup library]
